## Topic

Nosana Builders Challenge, 2nd edition
Agent-101: Build your first agent

## Description

The main goal of this `Nosana Builders Challenge` to teach participants to build and deploy agents. This first step will be in running a basic AI agent and giving it some basic functionality. Participants will add a tool, for the tool calling capabilities of the agent. These are basically some TypeScript functions, that will, for example, retrieve some data from a weather API, post a tweet via an API call, etc.

## [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra)

For this challenge we will be using Mastra to build our tool.

> Mastra is an opinionated TypeScript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations, and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

### Required Reading

We recommend reading the following sections to get started with how to create an Agent and how to implement Tool Calling.

- <https://mastra.ai/en/docs/agents/overview>
- [Mastra Guide: Build an AI stock agent](https://mastra.ai/en/guides/guide/stock-agent)

## Get Started

To get started run the following command to start developing:
We recommend using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), but you can try npm, or bun if you prefer.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Assignment

### Challenge Overview

Welcome to the Nosana AI Agent Hackathon! Your mission is to build and deploy an AI agent on Nosana.
While we provide a weather agent as an example, your creativity is the limit. Build agents that:

**Beginner Level:**

- **Simple Calculator**: Perform basic math operations with explanations
- **Todo List Manager**: Help users track their daily tasks

**Intermediate Level:**

- **News Summarizer**: Fetch and summarize latest news articles
- **Crypto Price Checker**: Monitor cryptocurrency prices and changes
- **GitHub Stats Reporter**: Fetch repository statistics and insights

**Advanced Level:**

- **Blockchain Monitor**: Track and alert on blockchain activities
- **Trading Strategy Bot**: Automate simple trading strategies
- **Deploy Manager**: Deploy and manage applications on Nosana

Or any other innovative AI agent idea at your skill level!

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the [Nosana Agent Challenge](https://github.com/nosana-ai/agent-challenge)** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Install dependencies** with `pnpm install`
4. **Run the development server** with `pnpm run dev`
5. **Build your agent** using the Mastra framework

### How to build your Agent

Here we will describe the steps needed to build an agent.

#### Folder Structure

Provided in this repo, there is the `Weather Agent`.
This is a fully working agent that allows a user to chat with an LLM, and fetches real time weather data for the provided location.

There are two main folders we need to pay attention to:

- [src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/](./src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/)
- [src/mastra/agents/your-agents/](./src/mastra/agents/your-agent/)

In `src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/` you will find a complete example of a working agent. Complete with Agent definition, API calls, interface definition, basically everything needed to get a full fledged working agent up and running.
In `src/mastra/agents/your-agents/` you will find a bare bones example of the needed components, and imports to get started building your agent, we recommend you rename this folder, and it's files to get started.

Rename these files to represent the purpose of your agent and tools. You can use the [Weather Agent Example](#example:_weather_agent) as a guide until you are done with it, and then you can delete these files before submitting your final submission.

As a bonus, for the ambitious ones, we have also provided the [src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/weather-workflow.ts](./src/mastra/agents/weather-agent/weather-workflow.ts) file as an example. This file contains an example of how you can chain agents and tools to create a workflow, in this case, the user provides their location, and the agent retrieves the weather for the specified location, and suggests an itinerary.

### LLM-Endpoint

Agents depend on an LLM to be able to do their work.

#### Nosana Endpoint

You can use the following endpoint and model for testing, if you wish:

```
MODEL_NAME_AT_ENDPOINT=qwen2.5:1.5b
API_BASE_URL= https://dashboard.nosana.com/jobs/GPVMUckqjKR6FwqnxDeDRqbn34BH7gAa5xWnWuNH1drf
```

#### Running Your Own LLM with Ollama

The default configuration uses a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) LLM.
For local development or if you prefer to use your own LLM, you can use [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) to serve the lightweight `qwen2.5:1.5b` mode.

**Installation & Setup:**

1. **[ Install Ollama ](https://ollama.com/download)**:

2. **Start Ollama service**:

```bash
ollama serve
```

3. **Pull and run the `qwen2.5:1.5b` model**:

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:1.5b
ollama run qwen2.5:1.5b
```

4. **Update your `.env` file**

There are two predefined environments defined in the `.env` file. One for local development and another, with a larger model, `qwen2.5:32b`, for more complex use cases.

**Why `qwen2.5:1.5b`?**

- Lightweight (only ~1GB)
- Fast inference on CPU
- Supports tool calling
- Great for development and testing

Do note `qwen2.5:1.5b` is not suited for complex tasks.

The Ollama server will run on `http://localhost:11434` by default and is compatible with the OpenAI API format that Mastra expects.

### Testing your Agent

You can read the [Mastra Documentation: Playground](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev) to learn more on how to test your agent locally.
Before deploying your agent to Nosana, it's crucial to thoroughly test it locally to ensure everything works as expected. Follow these steps to validate your agent:

**Local Testing:**

1. **Start the development server** with `pnpm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
2. **Test your agent's conversation flow** by interacting with it through the chat interface
3. **Verify tool functionality** by triggering scenarios that call your custom tools
4. **Check error handling** by providing invalid inputs or testing edge cases
5. **Monitor the console logs** to ensure there are no runtime errors or warnings

**Docker Testing:**
After building your Docker container, test it locally before pushing to the registry:

```bash
# Build your container
docker build -t yourusername/agent-challenge:latest .

# Run it locally with environment variables
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env yourusername/agent-challenge:latest

# Test the containerized agent at http://localhost:8080
```

Ensure your agent responds correctly and all tools function properly within the containerized environment. This step is critical as the Nosana deployment will use this exact container.

### Submission Requirements

#### 1. Code Development

- Fork this repository and develop your AI agent
- Your agent must include at least one custom tool (function)
- Code must be well-documented and include clear setup instructions
- Include environment variable examples in a `.env.example` file

#### 2. Docker Container

- Create a `Dockerfile` for your agent
- Build and push your container to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry

```sh

# Build and tag
docker build -t yourusername/agent-challenge:latest .

# Run the container locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 yourusername/agent-challenge:latest

# Login
docker login

# Push
docker push yourusername/agent-challenge:latest
```
